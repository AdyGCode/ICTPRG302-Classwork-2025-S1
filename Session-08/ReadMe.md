# File Exercises Continued

These exercises are for you to use as practice.

Make mistakes, correct them and enjoy the success as you complete each one.

If you are stuck, then ask for assistance from your lecturer, or from the
lecturer who is holding a Workshop Lab.

## Text files and other assets

The text files and other assets (for example, images) are saved in an 
`assets` folder within this session's folder.

Sometimes files will be linked to from previous session folders to reduce 
duplication and errors from said duplication.
