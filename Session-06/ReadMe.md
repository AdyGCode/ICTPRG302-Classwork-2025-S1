## filename: exercise-01.py

Write a Python script to concatenate the following 
dictionaries to create a new one.

```python
dictionary_1 = {1:10, 2:20}
dictionary_2 = {3:30, 4:40}
dictionary_3 = {5:50, 6:60}
```
Expected Result : {1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}

## filename: exercise-02.py

Write a Python script that:
- asks the user to input a number
- when the number is entered, it checks to see if
  the number is in the dictionary's keys
- if the key is found it outputs "Fount it!"
  followed by the value for the key

```python
value_dictionary = {
    1: "Hello", 
    2: "Goodbye", 
    3: "Who is this?"
} 
```

## filename: exercise-03.py

Write a Python script that calculates the total of the values from a dictionary.

In this example the dictionary will contain the rainfall for a week.

```python
week_rainfall = {
  "Mon":0,
  "Tue":3,
  "Wed":7,
  "Thu":1,
  "Fri":2,
  "Sat":6,
  "Sun":23
}
```

The program should output the result in the form:

```text
Total Rainfall: 45 mm
```
