### Version Control (Git)

The version control system, git, is listed here as ICTPRG302 is taught
before and simultaneously as other units that cover version control and
object-oriented programming.

### Microsoft Terminal

The MS Terminal is used as it provides a very robust tabbed interface that is
customisable and allows for adding additional 'shells' such as the
version of the Bash shell that is part of the git installation within Laragon.

### Laragon

**†** Our version of Laragon provides the following tools/services (and
others) for use across the complete Certificate IV in Information
Technology (Programming) and Diploma of Information Technology Courses:

- MySQL / MariaDB
- PostgreSQL
- Apache
- Composer
- Git
- HeidiSQL
- MailPit

## Useful Notes

Install and use:

- Microsoft Terminal
- Bash (From Laragon)

To create a set of folders quickly in BASH use {OPTION_LIST}. For example
to create the Session folders we can use:

```shell
mkdir Session-{{0,1}{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},20}
```

To add a `.gitignore` to the above folders use:

```shell
touch Session-{{0,1}{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9},20}/.gitignore
```

Example with folders and subfolders:

```shell
mkdir -p {public,assets/{css,js,img,webfonts,downloads,video}}
touch {public,assets/{css,js,img,webfonts,downloads,video}}/.gitignore

```
