# Working with Version Control

If you want a base to work with for a project in ICTPRG302, or any other 
Python based programming cluster, then you may use these instructions.

## Setting Up

Create a `Source/Repos` folder, change into the `Source/Repos` folder.

```shell
cd ~
mkdir -p Source/Repos
cd Source/Repos
```

> ### ðŸ›‘ Important: 
> 
> When working in Room 3-06 at TAFE, we need to use:
> 
> ```shell
> cd /c/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME
> mkdir -p Source/Repos
> cd Source/Repos
> ```
> 
> Remember to replace YOUR_USER_NAME with the username you logged into the 
> PC with.


### Clone the Base Repo

Clone the Base Project Repository, replacing the `XXX` with **YOUR** initials.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AdyGCode/AJG-ICTPRG302-Project-2025-s1.git XXX-ICTPRG302-Project-2025-s1
```

### Move into the Repo, and Activate Python Virtual Environment

Change into the new folder, add & activate Python virtual environment:

```shell
cd XXX-ICTPRG302-Project-2025-s1
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

> ### Note:
> Mac and Linux users will need to use `source .venv/bin/activate` instead 
> of `source .venv/Scripts/activate` for Windows users.

## Running the Application

To execute the program on the command line use:

```shell
python PYTHON_FILENAME.py
```

> ### Students TODO
> 
> Replace the `PYTHON_FILENAME` with the name of your python
> then delete this TODO.

# File Exercises Continued


These exercises are for you to use as practice.

Make mistakes, correct them and enjoy the success as you complete each one.

If you are stuck, then ask for assistance from your lecturer, or from the
lecturer who is holding a Workshop Lab.

## Text files and other assets

The text files and other assets (for example, images) are saved in an 
`assets` folder within this session's folder.

Sometimes files will be linked to from previous session folders to reduce 
duplication and errors from said duplication.
